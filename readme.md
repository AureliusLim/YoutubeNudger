# YouTube Nudger

YouTube Nudger is a Google Chrome extension that aims to regulate the consumption of YouTube due to the endless amount of content in the form of videos and shorts from different genres. It helps users to stay focused on their tasks and avoid procrastination by reminding them of what they were supposed to do at regular intervals.

## Features

- When the user visits YouTube, the extension shows a modal prompting the user to input the task they were supposed to do and the interval (in minutes) they want to be reminded of it.
- After the interval, the modal will appear on the screen again, asking the user if they want to continue browsing or exit YouTube. If the user chooses to continue browsing, the interval will be halved and the process will be repeated.
- If the user reaches the limit of three extensions, they will be kicked out of YouTube and redirected to Google.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

- Download the repository from GitHub and unzip it to a folder of your choice.
- Open Google Chrome and click on the menu icon (three dots) at the top right corner. Select More Tools > Extensions.
- Enable the Developer Mode toggle at the top right corner of the Extensions page.
- Click on Load Unpacked and select the folder containing the downloaded repository.
- Ensure that the extension is enabled and has the permission to access YouTube.

## Usage

To use the extension, simply navigate to YouTube and start watching any video. You will see a modal asking you to enter your task and interval. Enter the details and click on Submit. The modal will disappear and you can enjoy your video. After the interval, the modal will reappear and you can choose to continue browsing or exit YouTube. The extension will keep track of your extensions and kick you out of YouTube after the limit.
